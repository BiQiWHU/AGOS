# AGOS
Offcial implementation of our AGOS framework for remote sensing scene classification.

This work has been published in ```IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing``` entitled as ```All Grains, One Scheme (AGOS): Learning Multi-grain Instance Representation for Aerial Scene Classification```.

# Project Overview

# Enviroment dependency

The code is implemented on top of the Python3, and there are only a few dependencies that a development need to config.
Before starting the code, please ensure the below packages and the corresponding versions are available.
```
Python > 3.5

Tensorflow > 1.6

OpenCV > 3

Numpy > 1.16
```
